# Understanding Supabase Local Docker Defaults

## Why These Look Like Real Keys

The keys in `.env.local.example` look real because they ARE real - but they're **Docker defaults**, not secrets.

### These Keys Are:
- ✅ Published in Supabase documentation
- ✅ The same for EVERY local Supabase installation worldwide
- ✅ Only work with localhost:54321
- ✅ Safe to share and commit (though we don't to avoid confusion)
- ✅ Generated by `supabase init` command

### These Keys Are NOT:
- ❌ Production secrets
- ❌ Unique to your project
- ❌ Valid for any remote service
- ❌ Something that needs to be kept secret

## The Standard Docker Defaults

```bash
# Every Supabase local installation uses these EXACT values:
ANON_KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0

SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImV4cCI6MTk4MzgxMjk5Nn0.EGIM96RAZx35lJzdJsyH-qQwv8Hdp7fsn3W0YpN81IU

JWT_SECRET: super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long

DATABASE: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
```

## Why Not Use Placeholders?

We could use placeholders like:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-local-anon-key-here
```

But this would require developers to:
1. Run `supabase status` to get the keys
2. Copy each value manually
3. Risk copying them wrong

Since these are public Docker defaults, providing them saves time and prevents errors.

## Security Note

While these Docker defaults are safe, we still:
- Keep them in `.env.local` (gitignored) to establish good habits
- Never mix them with production values
- Clearly label them as Docker defaults

## If You're Uncomfortable

If you prefer placeholders, use `.env.template` instead, which has:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Then get your local values from:
```bash
supabase status
```

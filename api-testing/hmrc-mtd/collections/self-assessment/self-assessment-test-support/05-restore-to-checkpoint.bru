  ## Restore to Checkpoint
  
  This endpoint enables you to reset the stateful data back to the checkpoint created in the sandbox environment.

A valid checkpoint ID must be provided.

When you restore the checkpoint, the modified date of the data will be updated to the restored date.

**Note**: To prevent data loss or unexpected behaviour, the checkpoint restore should not be performed while any other stateful or checkpoint operations are in progress for the same National Insurance number.

  ## Create a Test Business
  
  This endpoint enables you to create a test business for use within the Sandbox environment.

Customers may have multiple Self-Employment businesses, but only one of each Property business is allowed. 
MTD supports only one accounting period per year so this must be a full tax year period, for example April 6th to April 5th. 
Test businesses are automatically purged from the database 7 days after creation.

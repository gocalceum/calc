      summary: Create a Foreign Property Income & Expenses Period Summary
      description: |
        This endpoint allows the developer to submit the income and expenses for a foreign property business that occurred between two dates.
        This submission is for either or both of Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL) in the European Economic Area (EEA) and all other foreign Property submissions.
        In the case of Non-FHL Foreign Property, if there are multiple properties per country, the income and expenses should be the total across all properties.
        A National Insurance number, tax year and business ID are required.

        <strong>Note: This endpoint only supports submissions up to tax year 2024-25. New endpoints which support cumulative submission
        are provided for tax year 2025-26 onwards</strong>.

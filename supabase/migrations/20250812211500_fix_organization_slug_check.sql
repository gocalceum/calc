-- Fix organization slug checking during onboarding
-- The issue: Users can't check if a slug exists before creating an organization

-- Add a policy that allows anyone to check if a slug exists (only slug field)
-- This is safe because it only exposes whether a slug is taken, not organization details
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can check slug availability" ON public.organizations
FOR SELECT
USING (true);  -- Allow everyone to SELECT (no WITH CHECK needed for SELECT)

-- Drop the existing restrictive SELECT policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their organizations" ON public.organizations;

-- Create a more specific policy for viewing full organization details
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their organizations" ON public.organizations
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Users can only see organizations they are members of
  id IN (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM public.organization_members 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND is_active = true
  )
);

-- Ensure the create_organization_with_owner function has proper permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION create_organization_with_owner TO authenticated;

-- Also fix the issue where new users might not have a profile yet
